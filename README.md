This is just a very small project I'm adding to get acquainted with GitHub. I am a beginner in Python, and I asked ChatGPT for some coding challenges I could try. I ended up with these two games, and a little menu to cycle through them.

It would be awesome if anyone wanted to contribute to this, any beginners who want to add simple games into the menu can do so as they please. Of course this goes for programming veterans who want to mess around with simple coding.

The games are just small functions. All that you need to do is define the function and add it to the "menu" at the end. So far the games are 1 (Guessing the Number) and 2 (Rock, Paper, Scissors). 3 is currently to exit but that can be changed if more games are added.

Additionaly, if anyone has any advice for me as a beginner, it is greatly welcomed and appreciated. Thank you if you are reading this!
